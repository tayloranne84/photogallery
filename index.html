							<h2>Definition of Fall</h2>
							<p>This picture represents the definition of Fall because of the beautiful colors of the leaves changing. I chose this picture to go first in the gallery because leaves are the first thing many people think of when it comes to Fall. </p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/02.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Fall Harvest</h2>
							<p>I included this picture because it reminded me of Thanksgiving. It adds a little something different to the gallery because it's something you wouldn't neccessarily think of to capture.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/03.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>The Corn Maze</h2>
							<p>Going off of the last picture, I found this corn field right off the side of the road down the street from where I live. It was a fun little adventure finding the area and capturing it on film.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/04.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Paint the sky red</h2>
							<p>Another beautiful picture of the changing leaves of Fall. I captured this picture from an upwards angle to show the contrast of the red and blue.</p>

						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/05.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Feel the Heat</h2>
							<p>I think this is the most unique picture I have in this gallery. Lighting a candle always reminds me of cooler weather during Fall days.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/06.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Acorns galore</h2>
							<p>Acorns are definitely a representation of Fall. I decided to get a close-up angle to give this gallery a variety of different types of photos.</p>

						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/07.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Colors of the season</h2>
							<p>This picture was taken at a beautiful brewery I found just driving around Blacksburg. The colors of the flowers and the butterfly went with my theme and nicely captured the essence of Fall.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/08.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/08.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Buy Local</h2>
							<p>This was also taken at the brewery and I chose to take this picture because of the different colors it had. I also like this picture because I think the words add variety to the gallery.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/09.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/09.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Antiques of Fall</h2>
							<p>What more than wooden logs and pumpkins screams Fall? I added this picture because it combined words, Fall items, and colors.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/10.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Rustic details</h2>
							<p>This picture represents dark versus light. I named it Rustic Details because you shouldn't look at the big picture, you have to look at all of the details to truly admire it.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/11.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/11.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>Blacksburg views</h2>
							<p>This picture is taken on one of my favorite roads in Blacksburg. I pulled over and took this picture, but honestly I don't believe pictures do Blacksburg's mountains justice. The views in person are the best ones to see. </p>

							<a href="images/fulls/12.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/12.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>What's a Hokie?</h2>
							<p>This picture was actually taken on my iPhone at the Virginia Tech versus Notre Dame game. It was my birthday and I got to share it with all my friends while we jumped for Enter Sandman. </p>

									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>My name is Taylor Thompson and I am a sophomore at Virginia Tech. I am majoring in Communication Studies and minoring in Sociology. These photos are my representation of Fall in Blacksburg, Virginia. I edited my pictures to bring out the warmth and color in them. I believe these photos accurately represent the beauty of Blacksburg. I hope you enjoy the gallery!  </p>
